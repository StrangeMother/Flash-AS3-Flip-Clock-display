So I need to write some documentation - but for now to get this working:

Create an instance of your digit on stage. The reason its done this way rather than built entirely via code - so its easier to maniplate the visuals.

if your instances of the flip digit are called 'd1', d2', etc... you may pass then into  your clock via the construct.

	import com.strangemother.display.clock.Clock

	var clock:Clock = new Clock(d1, d2, d3, d4);
	clock.start();

The clock has an internal timer - but you may use your own Timer instance.

Look through the class of Clock for more methods.

Enjoy.
